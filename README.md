## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

As someone who used Bootstrap as a crutch for all my layout and responsive
design, this project I set out to teach myself Flexbox and CSS Grid.

### Continued development

Since my JavaScript knowledge is currently limited to what I learnt from
some minor bugs I've fixed in React during my last internship, next project
I plan to teach myself the foundations of vanilla JavaScript by building a
more responsive web page.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/) - This helped me a lot when I was teaching myself CSS Grid.
